  read [ -ACSprsv ] [ -d delim] [ -n n] [ [ -N n] [ [ -t  timeout]  [  -u
   unit] [ vname?prompt ] [ vname ... ]
          The  shell  input  mechanism.  One line is read and is broken up
          into fields using the characters  in  IFS  as  separators.   The
          escape  character,  \, is used to remove any special meaning for
          the next character and for line  continuation.   The  -d  option
          causes  the  read  to  continue  to the first character of delim
          rather than new-line.
